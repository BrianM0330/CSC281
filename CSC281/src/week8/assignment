Assignment 8
Due Wednesday, May 29th, 9 pm

This assignment is challenging. Please start early.

The NumArrayList class has a single private instance variable L of type ArrayList<T> where T is a type that extends the abstract class Number. For example, both Integer and Double extend Number.  You are not allowed to create any extra variables in the class, other than variables local to the methods.

You will complete the assignment by writing the following methods for the NumArrayList class:

public NumArrayList(): The default constructor for the class. It instantiates the internal ArrayList L in the NumArrayList object by making an appropriate call to the ArrayList constructor.

public NumArrayList(T[] initValues): The parameterized constructor for the class. It instantiates the internal ArrayList L in the NumArrayList object by making an appropriate call 
to the ArrayList constructor. It then places the values in the array initValues into the new ArrayList object L.

public void add(T elem): The method adds the parameter to the internal ArrayList object L. Note that this method should be very short (1-2 lines).

public T get(int index): The method returns the element found in the internal ArrayList object L in position index. Note that this method should be very short (1-2 lines).

public String toString(): This method returns a String containing the elements found in the internal ArrayList object L. The elements should be separated by a space and the String should end with a 
newline. I suggest that you use a loop to build the String the method should return.

public NumArrayList<Integer> iMult(Integer val): The method returns a new NumArrayList object containing Integers which is created by taking the calling NumArrayList object and multiplying each of 
the values found in its internal ArrayList by val. You will need to use the intValue() method of the T class in order to implement this method.

I have provided a driver program (e.g. a main method that uses the NumArrayList class) TestNumArrayList.java to help you test your code which has been posted to D2L. Be aware that I may add to that program, so if you feel that any of your methods haven't been tested effectively by the driver program, please modify as necessary. However, you should only submit the NumArrayList.java class.

Below is the sample output that the test program produces for my solution to the NumArrayList class. Be aware that the test program puts random numbers into the lists, so the actual values you see when you run this likely will differ from what you see below:

The Integer NumArrayList: 96 98 97 2 38 66 81 31 50 48

The Double NumArrayList:
95.35
35.28
90.41
37.68
2.99
11.11
22.40
94.84
28.25
46.84

The result of calling iMult: 960 980 970 20 380 660 810 310 500 480
